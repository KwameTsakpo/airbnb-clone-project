### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding and documenting design properties in a mock-up, such as color styles and typography, is essential for maintaining consistency and professionalism across the application.  
It ensures that:
- The visual identity remains uniform across all pages.  
- Developers and designers work from the same reference, reducing miscommunication.  
- Accessibility and readability standards are met.  
- The overall user experience aligns with the project’s branding and usability goals.  

Identifying design properties early in the design phase helps bridge the gap between UI/UX design and frontend implementation, resulting in a more cohesive and polished final product.

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system because it minimizes friction in the user journey and increases customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, readable layouts, and intuitive interactions help users find and book properties quickly. By ensuring accessibility and responsiveness, the platform can provide a consistent experience across devices, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.

## UI Component Patterns

The Airbnb Clone project follows a component-based architecture to promote reusability, scalability, and consistency across the application. Each component is designed to be modular, easy to maintain, and adaptable to different views and screen sizes.

### Planned Components

#### Navbar
The Navbar serves as the primary navigation element across all pages.  
**Features:**
- Displays the application logo.  
- Includes a search bar for property lookup.  
- Provides user navigation options such as login, signup, and profile access.  
- Adapts responsively for both desktop and mobile screens.

#### Property Card
The Property Card component represents individual property listings in the Property Listing View.  
**Features:**
- Displays property images and essential details such as name, price, location, and rating.
